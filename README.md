This project utilizes the Spotify API to play music and allows users to guess the song from a selected playlist. Each correct answer earns points, and at the end, a percentage is calculated based on how many answers were correct. Points can optionally be stored in a database. Feedback is provided after each guess, and users can adjust the duration of the song clip they listen to. Additionally, they have the option to skip songs they find challenging. The game is developed in JavaScript.
